## Overview

This research has been developed to help Microsoft determine the profitability of entering the movie industry. The goal is to perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) model comparing the audience by generation to identify the movie releases that made the most revenue. This will help Microsoft determine the type of movie to make based on a targeted audience. The analysis will consist of the top 10 movies budget, ratings, and genre. This analysis is to get a sense of how movie tastes differ by age. The data comes from IMDB movies and ratings csv files.

The model for predicting the "Profit" is based on movie releases that made the most revenue, the comparison of generations, and the budget.   

## Business Problem

Microsoft will need to understand the type of film they wish to make for example identifying the product, genre, production cost, value etc. In other words, a film package that looks at the customers wants, needs and demands to identify a potential market for their film.

## Methods

***
The data preparation process began with finding the right dataset.
It included standardizing the data formats, altering the datasets, and removing outliers.
After collecting the data, it was important to discover each dataset. I had to get to know the data and determine what had to be done before the data became useful.

Cleaning up the data was the most time-consuming part of the analysis.  I had to remove unnecessary data and outliers and change any data type that was not consistent.
I updated the format of the data by adding, grouping and pinpointing the key data needed for each set of observations. I created visualizations that provided interactive, and easily readable plots to help view the data.

## Results

My thoughts

I conducted an analysis of the movies that have been created since 2010 and how the generations impacted the success of those movies focusing on the genre.  Though preparation, modelling, visualization and interpretation of the data, I took a dive in what drives movies goers based on which generation they were born.
 
When I originally thought about conducting this analysis, I had a lot of assumptions.  For instance, I thought the female would out weight the male voter participation.  Each generation proved to be the opposite.   Across all generations the voting for both males and females have been on a decline.  I can’t help but think how interesting it would be to explore the effects streaming platforms are having on box office profits in the film industry.
 
Therefore, I would suggest to Microsoft to focus of the millennials taste when it comes to thinking about the film package.  Specially the male voters, their voice had the loudest influence of all generations and gender.  Finally, the types of movies with the highest profit and with the lowest budget are comedy/drama.
